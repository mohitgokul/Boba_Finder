# Boba_Finder

## Execution of Code
Clone this repository
run the program in Jupyter Notebook
import the following packages in terminal
* import pandas
- import googlemaps
* import geocoder
## Overlook of the Problem
Build a HTTP server that can find the nearest available Boba shops to a particular customer Location

## Approach 
Programmed the project using Python in Jupyter Notebook.<br/>
Used Google Maps API for getting the Coordinates of the Boba shops and the Customer location using the Haversine Formula. <br/>
Added few "get" methods like get_geo, get get_names, get_gdf so that you can check whether the program is executing or not. <br/>
Input the data in a CSV file which contains two columns, one for Shop Name and one for the Address. <br/>

## Software & Tools Used
Google Maps API - To generate an API key for finding the Coordinates.<br/>
Jupyter Notebook - Build the project in Jupyter Notebook which is Python's IDE. <br/>
pandas - DataAnalytics library to read CSV file. <br/>
