# Boba_Finder

## Execution of Code
Clone this repository
run the program in Jupyter Notebook using the shell file

## Overlook of the Problem
Build a HTTP server that can find the nearest available Boba shops to a particular customer Location

## Approach 
Programmed the project using Python in Jupyter Notebook.  
Used Google Maps API for getting the Coordinates of the Boba shops and the Customer location using the Haversine Formula. 
Added few "get" methods like get_geo, get get_names, get_gdf so that you can check whether the program is executing or not. 
Input the data in a CSV file which contains two columns, one for Shop Name and one for the Address. 

## Software & Tools Used
Google Maps API - To generate an API key for finding the Coordinates
Jupyter Notebook - Build the project in Jupyter Notebook which is Python's IDE
pandas - DataAnalytics library to read CSV file
